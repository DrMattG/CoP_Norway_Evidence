[“A CoP is a group of people who share a common concern, a set of problems, or an interest in a topic and who come together to fulfil both individual and group goals”](http://www.communityofpractice.ca). In evidence synthesis CoPs are vital for sharing expertise, sharing experience, and developing new methods, tools and frameworks, for rigorous evidence synthesis. CoPs can be both within (e.g. https://www.cochrane.no/nb) and cross-disciplinary (e.g. http://www.gesiinitiative.com ), focusing on the entire evidence-informed decision-making process (e.g. https://jbi.global/) or on specific components of the process (e.g. https://www.eshackathon.org/). Evidence synthesis methodologies are discipline agnostic and therefore we can learn a lot from the experience of other fields.
